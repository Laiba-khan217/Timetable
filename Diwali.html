   <center> <p><pre>         Diwali, also known as Deepavali or the Festival of Lights, is one of the
         most significant and celebrated festivals in India and among the global Hindu,
         Jain, Sikh, and some Buddhist communities. The name derives from the Sanskrit 
         term "Dīpāvalī," meaning "row of lights," symbolizing the spiritual victory of 
         light over darkness, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, and Dharma over 
         Adharma. It is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar months of Ashvin and Kartik,
        typically falling between mid-September and mid-November in the Gregorian calendar</pre></p></center>
