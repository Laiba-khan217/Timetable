    <center><p><pre>    Independence Day in India is celebrated annually on 15 August as a public 
    holiday, commemorating the nation's independence from British colonial rule on
    15 August 1947. This date marks the enactment of the Indian Independence Act 
    1947, which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent 
    Assembly and led to the creation of the independent dominions of India and
    Pakistan. The day is observed nationwide with flag-hoisting ceremonies, 
    parades, cultural events, and the singing of the national anthem, "Jana Gana
    Mana". The central event takes place at the Red Fort in Delhi, where the Prime
    Minister hoists the national flag and delivers a televised address to the nation.</pre></p></center>
