   <p ><pre id="para1">Holi is a major Hindu festival celebrated as the Festival of Colours, Love, 
    and Spring, marking the triumph of good over evil and the arrival of spring.
      It is observed annually on the full moon day (Purnima) of the Hindu month of 
      Phalguna, which typically falls in late February or March in the Gregorian calendar.
       The festival is celebrated with great enthusiasm across India, Nepal, and by 
       Indian diaspora communities worldwide, featuring the playful throwing of colored 
       powders and water, music, dancing, and festive foods.</pre></p>
